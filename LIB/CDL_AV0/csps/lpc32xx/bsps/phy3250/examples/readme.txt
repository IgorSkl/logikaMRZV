DESCRIPTION
===========
   This is a port of the NXP Common Driver Library (CDL) Package version 1.01 and Phytec3250 examples for use with
   IAR's EWARM. 
   This port does not include the S1L bootloader. Instead it has a simple bootloader which allows stand alone execution
   of the examples.

COMPATIBILITY
=============
   The examples are compatible with Phytec LPC3250 evaluation board.
   By default, the project is configured to use the
   J-Link JTAG interface.

   See lpc32xx_readme.txt, phytec_readmy.txt and CDL docs. You can download them from NXP website.

CONFIGURATIONS
=============

 Each example has the following configurations
 
   Debug_iRAM: This configuration is intended for debugging in the microcontroller's internal RAM.

   Debud_xRAM: This configuration is intended for debugging in the external SDRAM.

   Release_xRAM_boot_from_NAND: This confuguration will download the example and the bootloader in
                                the NAND flash. It is intended for example stand alone execution.

GETTING STARTED
===============

  1) Start the IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM.

  2) Select File->Open->Workspace...
     Open the following workspace:

     <installation-root>\arm\examples\NXP\LPC3250\nxpmcu\software\csps\lpc32xx\bsps\phy3250\examples\LPC3250.eww

  3) Select an example and configuration.

  4) Power the board and connect the J-Link.
 
  5) Press CTRL+D or use Download and Debug button to start a debug session.
