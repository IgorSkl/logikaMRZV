 Move Data from SSP data register(SSP0DR-0x2008 4008 ) unstable.
 Hello, I am writing a program that moves data through SSP channel.
 It properly worked on SSP whith interrupt. 
 But I need to send and receive 512 bytes through  SSP channel on DMA channel hardware.
 I`m allocate dma chanell 6 for transmittion and dma channel 7 on reception.
 Program whith dma chanell 6 works properly. But whith dma chanell 7 not.
 Once program   receive 512 bytes properly. But then program don`t receive data.
What is wrong?
